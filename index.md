# My Design Manifesto

## Introduction

No two people see color the same way. What you see as blue somewhat else might call cyan or turquoise. If we all saw the world the same way, there would be no individuality. There would be no arguments. There would be no problems to solve. There would be no progress. You always hear about *the* design process. The right way to do something. The correct way to approach a situation. But what happens when the “right” approach doesn’t work for you?

Having an individual design process creates an environment for healthy and strong ideas to grow. This course has taught me to think deeper about my design process. I usually just do things without much thought into each individual step. To me, the process has always been stepping blocks towards a final goal. Usually, this means I rush through different stages of the design process. This class has taught me to take a step back and take a closer look at how I approach a problem. 

This manifesto will highlight my main takeaways from each step of the design process. I believe my work throughout this class has showcased my personal design process as it has been intertwined with my classmates.

This class has been rapid fire design, but my advice for anyone looking to improve on their design process is to emphasize the small things. Even the smallest of tasks can lead to the best result. For the rest of my time I will highlight my top five most important design process points. These are the five things I realized were items I would pass over but now see are vital to the design process.

## Brainstorm like the wind

There are many different ways to brainstorm. We utilized many of these techniques throughout the course. We had individual time to think about the problem then collected all the thoughts in a sticky note exercise which is pictured below.

We had stream of consciousness brainstorms both during the topic picking phase of some of the projects and during the smaller subtasks for our final product. Pictured below is a product brainstorm for the design for wellbeing design sprint, and a subtask brainstorm for when we decided which topics we wanted to talk about in our chatbot. 

Brainstorming can be done at any time during the design process, which is why I believe it is the most important part of the design process. It can be utilized when trying to figure out what to portray and can also be used when trying to find the best ways to portray such data. We also utilized the 5-brainstorming sheet technique, which shows the evolution from the initial brainstorm to the final decision made before actual implementation. 


## Don't be afraid to reevaluate (Evolution is Inevitable)

Sometimes the first idea is not always the best idea. Honestly, most of the time, the first idea is never the best idea. Evolution of ideas is going to happen, and should be encouraged. To create the best product possible you have to combine ideas from multiple people or at least get feedback on what you have created. The design for tension design sprint is the biggest example of this. Our team had originally decided on being a one-sided and persuasive chat bot, but as time went on, we realized that we did not have enough time to create the correct vernacular for our chatbot to remain constantly biased. We needed to create a chat bot that would be much more informational and less persuasive. Thus, our initial idea of being outlandish and outright biased was not the best solution to our problem. Our team knew when to change the current course and take a much more subtle approach to the assignment. 

## Know your goals (Be Specific)

Being able to express what your interface does in words is just as important as letting your interface speak for itself.

## Theme and Color set the tone

It is one thing to make an interface that is easy to use, it is another thing completely to make something that is visually appealing to users. This should be one of the last things you do in your design process, as it is the last stage of development. After you have figured out all the things you want to show, making it look good is next. The first design sprint, design for others, was the only time we extensively looked at the aesthetic aspects of design. This is because it should take a back seat until the actual development is finished. With that said, it is always taken into consideration. As a designer, knowing what looks good and what is useful to users go hand in hand. Making sure you have a good grasp on your design aesthetic, you can implement anything that is well made and good looking.

I personally enjoyed the redesign of a existing website, as it allowed us to focus on a demographic and make something appealing. Below is the mood board for this design sprint. 

## Users are your friend!

User testing gives real life unbiased feedback to a product. You can stare at your interface for hours and believe it is the best thing you have ever produced, but the smallest things could be off about it. Utilizing the user testers was something I did not think was going to be very helpful. I was proven wrong, specifically for the charts in the design for understanding design sprint. One of our testers pointed out that our graphs were off, something that I, as the designer, did not notice. I felt good about the prototype being presented, but the tester was able to show me there was an issue. This allowed me to fix it and helped my team members fix any issues they were also having with their graphs. Below is the before and after pictures of the graphs where the data was wrong.
